Polyester artificial blood vessels are widely used in vascular surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafts, peripheral vascular disease treatments, and hemodialysis access procedures. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in medical technologies, and the rising adoption of synthetic blood vessels are the key factors driving market growth. The market is anticipated to see significant growth due to an increasing demand for minimally invasive procedures, as well as a growing geriatric population that is more susceptible to vascular conditions. Polyester-based synthetic blood vessels are preferred for their high strength, durability, and biocompatibility, which contribute to the increasing adoption rate in vascular surgeries.</p><h2>Polyester Artificial Blood Vessel Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The polyester artificial blood vessel market, by application, is primarily segmented into coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease, hemodialysis, and others. The coronary artery bypass graft segment is projected to dominate the market during the forecast period due to the rising prevalence of coronary artery disease and the growing demand for effective surgical solutions. Polyester grafts are widely used in CABG procedures, owing to their high tensile strength and ease of use. The peripheral vascular disease segment is also expected to see significant growth as polyester artificial blood vessels offer a viable alternative for the treatment of blocked or narrowed arteries in the legs, arms, and other peripheral regions. These devices are used in both open surgeries and minimally invasive procedures, contributing to their increasing adoption in vascular surgeries.</p><h2>Polyester Artificial Blood Vessel Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>In addition to coronary artery bypass grafting and peripheral vascular disease, the hemodialysis segment is another key area driving demand for polyester artificial blood vessels. These vessels are utilized in the creation of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts for patients undergoing long-term dialysis treatments. The increasing incidence of kidney diseases and the growing number of patients requiring dialysis are expected to boost the market for polyester artificial blood vessels in this application. The use of polyester-based grafts in hemodialysis is favored due to their high durability and biocompatibility, which help ensure long-term patency and reduce complications. The 'Others' segment, which includes applications in various types of vascular surgeries, also contributes to the market growth, although at a relatively smaller scale compared to the primary applications of CABG, peripheral vascular disease, and hemodialysis.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Polyester Artificial Blood Vessel Market  worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Getinge</Li><Li> Terumo Group</Li><Li> Gore</Li><Li> B.
